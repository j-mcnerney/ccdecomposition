This method is described in [Kavlak G, McNerney J, Trancik JE, “Evaluating the causes of cost reduction in photovoltaic modules”, Energy Policy 123, 700 - 710 (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421518305196).\n","\n","Cost change decomposition is useful for studying a technology or production process for which cost be expressed as an equation in a set of underlying variables, and one has data on how these variables have changed (or will) over time.  For example, in the reference above, the authors analyzed the drivers of cost evolution in solar modules.  The costs of a solar module (dollars per kWh) can be modeled as\n","$$\n","C = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma A \\eta y} \\left[ A \\nu \\rho p_s + cA + p_0 \\left( \\frac{K}{K_0} \\right)^{-b} \\right],\n","$$\n","where symbols have the following meanings:\n","\n","| Symbol   | Meaning                                | Type      |\n","|:--------:|----------------------------------------|-----------|\n","| $A$      | wafer area                             | variable  |\n","| $y$      | manufacturing yield                    | variable  |\n","| $\\eta$   | module efficiency                      | variable  |\n","| $\\eta$   | silicon usage                          | variable  |\n","| $p_s$    | polysilicon price                      | variable  |\n","| $c$      | per-area cost of non-silicon materials | variable  |\n","| $K$      | manufacturing plant size               | variable  |\n","| $\\alpha$ | module area utilization                | parameter |\n","| $\\sigma$ | solar constant                         | parameter |\n","| $\\rho$   | wafer density                          | parameter |\n","| $K_0$    | reference manufacturing plant size     | parameter |\n","| $p_0$    | cost of reference plant                | parameter |\n","| $b$      | scaling factor                         | parameter |\n","\n","Improvements in variables such as wafer area, manufacturing yield, and others caused significant reductions in the cost of solar modules over time.  Cost change decomposition provides a sytematic method for quantifying the separate contributions of these variable to cost reduction.  The mathematical details of this approach are given in [the reference above](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421518305196).

The results are returned in a data frame from which a user can carry out further anaylsis.\n","\n","The library is in a very early beta stage.
